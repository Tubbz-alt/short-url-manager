# Short URL manager

Publishing tool to request, approve and create Short URLs on GOV.UK.

##Technical documentation

Short URLs are a short and easy to type URL that redirects to a piece of content at a much longer URL.

They are often used on posters, in leaflets or over the phone, so they are easy to use. For example:

```
/dwp/cps5
```
to
```
/government/publications/your-state-pension-estimate-explained-cps5
```

Currently this tool allows departmental users to request redirects within the scope of their department, eg, under `dwp` above. Future versions may add workflow for requesting/managing top level Short URLs, eg, `/ebola` to `/government/topical-events/ebola-government-response`.

## Dependencies
* MongoDB - main data store
* Redis - for distributed locking using
  [mlanett/redis-lock](https://github.com/mlanett/redis-lock)
* [alphagov/gds-sso](http://github.com/alphagov/gds-sso): Provides authentication OmniAuth adapter to allow apps to sign in via GOV.UK auth
* [alphagov/publishing-api](http://github.com/alphagov/publishing-api): the central store of published content on GOV.UK. Once a redirect has been accepted, redirects are registered to this API.

## Content Schema Validations

You will need a copy of [govuk-content-schemas](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-content-schemas) on your file system. By default these should be in a sibling directory to your project. Alternatively, you can specify their location with the `GOVUK_CONTENT_SCHEMAS_PATH` environment variable.
